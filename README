Striptease - a simple webcomics server
2013 Mathilda Hartnell

This is a simple webapp written in ruby/sinatra for hosting a webcomic. Not much to look at now, but here's my list of goals I plan to implement for the first release:

1. Basic SQLite model #DONE as of 16.2.2013
2. Getting comics by URL / Navigating the archives #DONE as of 27.2.2013, archives are buggy
3. Example theme #DONE as of 27.2.2013
4. Admin panel
  4.1 Adding / deleting / editing comics
  4.2 Managing css / templates
5. Mini-blog for rants #Added hook model
6. RSS feed management
7. Automatic comic/rant posting
8. Installation script
